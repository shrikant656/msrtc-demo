                                                         <p>Natural Gas is mainly Methane - CH4 with a small percentage of other higher hydrocarbons. The ratio of carbon to hydrogen is least in methane and hence it burns almost completely making it the cleanest fuel. It is produced from the oil / gas wells and transported through a network of pipelines across the country.</p>
